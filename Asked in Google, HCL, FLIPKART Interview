Q). Determine whether an array can be divided into pairs with a sum divisible by `k`
    Given an integer array, determine whether it can be divided into pairs such that the sum of elements in each pair is divisible by a given positive integer k.
    
    
    
    For example,

 Input:
 arr[] = { 3, 1, 2, 6, 9, 4 }
 k = 5
 
 Output: Pairs can be formed
 
 Explanation: Array can be divided into pairs {(3, 2), (1, 9), (4, 6)} where the sum of elements in each pair is divisible by 5.
 
 
 Input:
 arr[] = { 2, 9, 4, 1, 3, 5 }
 k = 6
 
 Output: Pairs can be formed
 Explanation: Array can be divided into pairs {(2, 4), (9, 3), (1, 5)} where the sum of elements in each pair is divisible by 6.
 
 
Input:
arr[] = { 3, 1, 2, 6, 9, 4 }
k = 6
 
Output: Pairs cannot be formed
 
Explanation: Array cannot be divided into pairs where the sum of elements in each pair is divisible by 6.



Brute-Force Solution
A naive solution is to iterate over array arr and consider each element arr[i] as the first element of a pair. Then process the remaining elements to find 
the first non-visited element arr[j] which satisfies the relation (arr[j] + arr[i]) % k == 0. If a pair is found for all elements, return true; otherwise, 
return false.

The time complexity of this approach is O(n2), where n is the input size and requires O(n) extra space. Following is the C, Java, and Python program that 
demonstrates it:


coding for the solution:


class Main
{
    // Determine if an array can be divided into pairs such that the sum of elements
    // in each pair is divisible by the given integer `k`
    public static int findPairs(int[] arr, int k)
    {
        // base case: input contains an odd number of elements
        // (an odd number of elements cannot be paired)
        if (arr.length % 2 == 1) {
            return 0;
        }
 
        // create a boolean array to mark elements that formed a pair
        int[] visited = new int[arr.length];
 
        // initialize visited array by value 0
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            visited[i] = 0;
        }
 
        // consider each element as the first element of a pair
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length - 1; i++)
        {
            // ignore the current element if it is already part of another pair
            if (visited[i] != 0) {
                continue;
            }
 
            // find the first non-visited element `arr[j]` that forms a pair with
            // `arr[i]`
            int j = i + 1;
            while (j < arr.length)
            {
                if (visited[j] == 0 && (arr[j] + arr[i]) % k == 0)
                {
                    // pair found `(arr[i], arr[j])`
                    visited[j] = 1;
                    break;
                }
                j++;
            }
 
            // return 0 if pair not found for the current element
            if (j == arr.length) {
                return 0;
            }
        }
 
        // we reach here only when each element forms a pair
        return 1;
    }
 
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        int[] arr = { 2, 9, 4, 1, 3, 5 };
        int k = 6;
 
        if (findPairs(arr, k) != 0) {
            System.out.println("Pairs can be formed");
        }
        else {
            System.out.println("Pairs cannot be formed");
        }
    }
}
